# Real-Estate-Scaner
A program that uses Selenium to drill a real estate website and collect data.

I made this program for my personal use, to help me find the best property. It uses Selenium to collect certain data from a real estate site, like prices, locations, land areas etc. Then, based on collected locations, it uses Google Maps to calculate and collect distance data to two of the boggest cities in Slovenia (Ljubljana and Maribor). At the end, it will autopulate a Google Sheet with all those data.
